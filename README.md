# ICPC Problem Solving

This repository contains my collection of problem-solving code, resources, and notes gathered during ACM ICPC training and programming contests. It includes problems from various online judges, university contests, and boot camps.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

Each folder represents a category or contest. Here's an overview:

- `ACM_2018`, `ACM_2019`, `ACM_2021`: Problems from past ACM ICPC contests.
- `Array`, `Matrix`, `Graph`, `String`, `Dynamic_Programming`: Topic-wise problems.
- `CodeChef`, `Hackerrank`, `HackerEarth`, `Geeksforgeeks`: Problems from specific platforms.
- `BootCamp01`, `BootCamp02`, `BootCamp_Contest`: Bootcamp sessions and contests.
- `Basic`, `OOP_Concept`, `Learn_python`, `C++`: Language fundamentals and practice.
- `Divided_&_Conquer`, `Greedy_Algorithm`, `Graph_Algorth`, etc.: Algorithm-based problem sets.

## üìú Files

- Various `.py` and `.txt` files are included in the root directory for standalone problem solutions, testing, and notes.

## üîß How to Use

You can browse through the folders and open any `.py` file to view the problem solution. Most files include:
- Problem name
- Problem description (if added)
- Python implementation

## üß† Purpose

This repository is for:
- Practicing data structures and algorithms
- Preparing for ICPC and other competitive programming contests
- Organizing and reviewing solved problems by topic and contest

## üöÄ Contributions

This is a personal repository, but feel free to:
- Suggest improvements
- Fork for your own use
- Learn from the structured practice

## üìÖ Status

Active learning and solving problems regularly.
